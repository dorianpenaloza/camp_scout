CampScout was built with the principles of Model,
View, Controller and uses Ruby-on-Rails as it's main framework.

The gmaps4rails gem was used to display the maps 
https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails

Google's Geocoding API allowed for addresses to be converted into geographic coordinates in order to display them as markers.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/

The search field uses a form to pass a city/zip code input along with a distance parameter and returns a hash that gmaps4rails uses to render the markers.

The comparison function accepts a campâ€™s information (id) and pushes it through a session array. This array is used to display the collected information on a filtered comparison page.

Special thanks to https://github.com/walterlatimer and https://github.com/thejuliekramer for your time and help.
I also want to thank https://github.com/EldonYoder for helping me with the Google Maps API.
