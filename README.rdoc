== README


CampScout was built with the principles of Model,
View, Controller and uses Ruby-on-Rails as it's main framework.

The <a style="color:#f65" href="https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails">gmaps4rails</a> gem was used to display the maps and <a style="color:#9cc" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/">Google's Geocoding API</a> allowed for addresses to be converted into geographic coordinates in order to display them as markers.

The search field uses a form to pass a city/zip code input along with a distance parameter and returns a hash that gmaps4rails uses to render the markers.

The comparison function accepts a campâ€™s information (id) and pushes it through a session array. This array is used to display the collected information on a filtered comparison page.
